PlayTogether
====================

PlayTogether is a project created for the [Chicago Migrahack event](http://www.chicagomigrahack.com/). PlayTogether is a tool for parents to easily search for a sporting event/activity near their neighbourhood for their kids to participate in. The tool relies primarily on visual imagery to help breaking the culture and language barriers new immigrant families may face when trying to settle into a new community. 

By leveraging the universal passion for sports, one of the few things that trencsends race, religion, creed and culture, the tool hopes to address a very specific issue in the hope of being part of a larger solution in creating a channel for immigrant children to ease into their local communities. 

The data behind the tool is stubbed out using the Youth Centers dataset from the City of Chicago: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Youth-Centers/meks-hp6f

The prototype application can be accessed here: http://paulyuan.ca/playtogether
